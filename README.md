## Space travel
 Author: Anna Zadka

This project is my own version of the classic "Galaxian" game. The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible by shooting down the meteorites in 20 seconds. Additionally, space debris falls on the player, which must be avoided in order not to lose health points. I've created two versions of the game: easy and hard. In the hard version, the space debris fall off more often than in the easy one. The game ends after 20 seconds or when you lose all your health points.
